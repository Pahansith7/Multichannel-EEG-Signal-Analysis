# Multi-Channel EEG Analysis Using EEGLAB

---
## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing multi-channel EEG data using the MATLAB-based EEGLAB toolbox. 
Various preprocessing steps and analyses, including Independent Component Analysis (ICA), are performed to explore brain activities, eye movements, muscle activity, and noise artifacts in EEG recordings.
---

## Contents
- Data Preprocessing: Includes re-referencing, normalization, artifact removal and event segmentation.
- Independent Component Analysis (ICA): Used for identifying and categorizing components related to brain activities, eye movements, muscle activity, and noise.
- Spectral Analysis: Examines frequency-domain characteristics, such as alpha rhythms and high-frequency noise.
- Scalp topography: Used to localize brain activities.
